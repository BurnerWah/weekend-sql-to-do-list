# Weekend SQL To-Do List

## Description

_Duration: 3 Day Sprint_

This is a fairly simple To-Do list web app, which is made using Node.js and Postgres. It allows the user to add tasks to a list, mark them as completed, and delete them.

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run start` in your terminal
5. Open up your browser and go to `localhost:5001`
